Welcome to RepairDispenser!

To repair an item:

1) Create a dispenser.
2) Place dispenser, and hook up some sort of redstone power source (button, switch, pressure plate, etc.) that will activate the dispenser.
3) Place used tool into dispenser, along with at least 1 item of raw material (ex. an iron pickaxe requires at least 1 iron ingot).
4) Press the "dispense" switch (whatever redstone power source you hooked up in step 2).
5) Presto! A (partially) repaired tool (that even keeps its enchantment)!


Durability repair is calculated by taking the number of raw material required to originally craft the weapon, and diving up the amount repaired based on the number of raw materials present.

Example:

Item		Material to Make	% Repaired per Raw Material
-----		----------------	---------------------------
Sword		2					50%  (1 / 2)
Pickaxe		3					33%  (1 / 3)
Shovel		1					100% (1 / 1)
Chestpiece	7					14%  (1 / 7)
